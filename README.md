## Welcome!

Welcome, I'm Roberto Cinetto and this my website repository.

The website is built on top of NextJS and Strapi. I'm not really showcasing this repository but a dear friend of mine and an actual good dev, suggested me to include a brief readmi anyway.

The website is basically my resume but I'm planning on keeping a blog. This is way I used Strapi as CMS. This

Hope you enjoy it!

Roberto
